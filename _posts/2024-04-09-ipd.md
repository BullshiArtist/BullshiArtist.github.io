If you want more details or information about how to use git you can use the reference link or search online.

## Preliminaries
In git the file have four status:

Untracked: This means the file is not tracked by the git

you can use the command below (remember to replace the file_path to you real file path):
```bash
git add file_path
```
you can add multiple files at one time by use the space to separate them like below:
```bash
git add file_path1 file_path2
```

## 2. Commit the change
- Commits the staged changes to the local repository with a descriptive message.

You can use the command below:
```bash
git commit -m "descriptive message"
```

## 3. git status
- Displays the status of the working directory and staging area.

You can see that this command will show all the file status in the current repository. 

And the first line will show the current branch you are in.

![git status](/images/git/git-status.png "git status")

You can use the command below:
```bash
git status
```

## 4. git pull
- Fetches changes from a remote repository and integrates them into the local repository.

This command will update you local code to the newest version of the remote code.

```

## 5. git push
- Pushes committed changes to a remote repository.

This command will push the last commit to the remote repository.

you can use the command below:
```bash
git push alias/branch_name
```

The alias here is mean the alias of you remote repository you set, most situation is origin.

The branch_name is the branch you want to push to remote repository.

- Switches to the specified branch.

You can use the command below (Remember to replace the branch_name to your real branch name):
```bash
git checkout branch_name
```

## 7. git log
